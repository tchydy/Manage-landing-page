## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- Javascript




### What I learned

For the first time I tried out tailwind css. I most say it easy to understand although there were some challenges I faced at the beginning but with the Tailwind documentation I found some work arounds. For instance most of the sizes in this project are in pixels. The tailwind sizing required a lot of adjusting/ converting. So thankfully they were rooms for custom values and custom CSS styles outside HTML. 
Asides using Tailwind CSS major learnings were from coding the form and slider sections. They were challenging for me so had to pull resources to achieve what I have done


### Continued development

- Make slider cards snap to container edge when in close proximity.

### Useful resources

- [Docs for tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The documentation is really straightforward I preferred using it than videos or blogs.
- [Customize form error message](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - Client-side form validation - Learn web development | MDN.
